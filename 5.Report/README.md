# Requirements
# Introduction
   Functioning of LED is a simple project in the Embedded progamming domain. There are several ways to make a LED circuit. You can make one using relays. You can        make one using transistors. Or you can make one using components like an inverter, a 555 Timer or a microcontroller. 
# Objective
   The objective is to function the led using ATmega328 and a switch to controll two LED's.
# Components used
1.ATmega328   

2.Two LED 

3.Switch

4.Resistor
# software used
1.simulIDe

2.Visual Studie Code


# Features
   It has simple features.
       
    1.It can switch off the LED's when switch is in off state.
    2.It can switch on the LED's when switch is in on state.
# 4W's and 1 H's
   ## Why
    1.To Function two LED's using a switch in ATmega328.
    2.To understand basic concepts in ATmega328.
   ## Where
    1. It can be used anywhere.
    2. It can be used for understanding purposes in schools and colleges.
   ## Who
    1.It can be used by students and trainees.
    2.It can be used by anyone who are new to embedded programming language.
   ## When
    1.People when they are in need to learn embedded programming language.
    2.Mostly it can be done as projects in schools and colleges 
   ## How
    1.By using softwares(C programming) to exceute the program.
    2.By uploading the program in ATmega328.
# SWOT Analysis
   ## Strengths
    1.Simple program to understand.
    2.Cost effective.
   ## Weakness
    1.Basic program.
   ## Opportunities
    1.Program can be made more complex by adding more components and adding new structures.
   ## Threats
    1.There are advanced programs which are far better than this.
